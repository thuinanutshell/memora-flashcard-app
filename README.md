# Memora - Flashcard App
During this summer, I have to prepare for technical interviews. There are many new and old concepts that I have to learn. So I want a space to help me perform deliberate practice and record my thought processes along the way. Memora is a flashcard app that helps you create, organize, and analyze your study decks and cards.

## Key Features
1. Users can create folders and different study decks inside the folders
2. Users can create flashcards inside the study deck (question, answer, and difficulty level)
3. A spaced repetition algorithm that reminds users of the number of cards to review today, in 7 days, or in one month
4. An analytics dashboard to show accuracy score of each folder and study deck over time.

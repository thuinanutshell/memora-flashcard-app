# Memora - Flashcard App
During this summer, I have to prepare for technical interviews. There are many new and old concepts that I have to learn. So I want a space to help me perform deliberate practice and record my thought processes along the way. Memora is a flashcard app that helps you create, organize, and analyze your study decks and cards.

## Key Features
1. Users can create folders and different study decks inside the folders
2. Users can create flashcards inside the study deck (question, answer, and difficulty level)
3. A spaced repetition algorithm is employed to remind users of the number of cards to review today, in 7 days, or in one month
4. An analytics dashboard to show the accuracy score of each folder and study deck over time.
   
## Backend (Flask-Python)
### Database Design
### RESTful APIs
## Frontend (JavaScript-React)
## How to Run the App
## Key Takeaways
- Standardizing the format and structure of the backend response (success, failure, duplicated, etc.) is tremendously helpful for integrating with the frontend, especially when rendering the data like lists. I encountered several bugs when fetching the data from the backend to the frontend because the structure of the response message is either nested or inconsistent.

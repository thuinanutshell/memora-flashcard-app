    "Your learning progress is solid! You've mastered 45% of your total cards and have been consistently reviewing. I notice you tend to score higher in the mornings - have you considered scheduling your most challenging topics then?",

    "Based on your learning patterns, I'd suggest:\n\nâ€¢ Spacing out your reviews more evenly throughout the day\nâ€¢ Focusing on your weaker topics (like History) for 15 minutes daily\nâ€¢ Using active recall instead of just re-reading\nâ€¢ Setting specific, small goals like 'master 5 cards today'",
    "Some effective strategies for your study style:\n\nâ€¢ Try studying your hardest subjects when you're most alert\nâ€¢ Use visual aids and diagrams for complex concepts\nâ€¢ Practice retrieval by closing your notes and testing yourself\nâ€¢ Connect new information to real-world examples"

  specific_subject: [
    "For Mathematics, I notice you're doing well with Algebra but struggling a bit with Geometry. Try visualizing geometric concepts and drawing diagrams. Practice with real-world examples like calculating areas of rooms or angles in architecture.",
    "Your History performance could improve with some storytelling techniques. Try connecting historical events to create narratives. Use timeline visualizations and relate events to things happening in your own life or current events.",
    "In Science, you're excelling at Physics but Chemistry needs attention. For Chemistry, focus on understanding patterns in the periodic table and practice balancing equations step by step. Visual models can really help!"
